* `amod`: numerical VME address modifier. Must match the transfer type.
  Passing a non-block amod to a block read command is an error.
* `data_width`: `d16` or `d32`.
* `esst_rate`: numeric rate value. 0=160mb, 1=276mb, 2=320mb.
* The `swapped` variants swap the two 32-bit words in each 64-bit word.
* The `mem` variants do increment the read address. Non-`mem` means FIFO mode.
* `transfers` is an unsigned 16-bit value, so the max transfer count for block
  reads is 0xffff.
* `late` means to read out on the trailing edge of the DTACK signal instead of
  at the leading edge. Required for some modules, e.g. TRIVA.

## The stack accumulator

The **vme_read** and **vme_read_mem** commands usually return a single data word
not contained in a block read structure. When used in combination with the MVLC
stack accumulator these commands turn into block reads and produce block read
output structures.

```
# Reads 100 times from address 0x0000.
set_accu 100
vme_read 0x09 d16 0x0000

# Reads 100 times from the device, incrementing the address after each read.
set_accu 100
vme_read_mem 0x09 d16 0x0000
```

In combination with **read_to_accu** and **mask_shift_accu** this can be used to
read a transfer count from a module to create a fake block transfer.

**signal_accu** creates an MVLC internal IRQ signal using the current accu
value. This can be used to dispatch from one stack to another: read a value from
a module into the accu, optionally **mask_shift_accu** it to exctract a
trigger/IRQ number, then call **signal_accu** to dispatch to the actual handler
stack.

### mask_shift_accu

The **mask_shift_accu** operation is applied at the time the accumulator value
needs to be evaluated, for example when a **vme_read** instruction is processed.
This means **mask_shift_accu** can be set before the actual read to accu. Also
multiple **mask_shift_accu** commands do not modify the accu but instead the
last command applies it's mask and rotation to the accu at evaluation time.

### compare_loop_accu

This command needs to follow a **read_to_accu** or **set_accu** command.
Compares the current accu value against the static compare value. If the
comparison fails loops back to the previous read instruction. Otherwise
continues executing the next command.

Comparators: 0: equals, 1: less than, 2: greater than.

If the comparison fails loop will terminate after ~5Âµs and the **timeout** flag
will be set in the resulting **0xF3 StackFrame**

# VME block read command mappings

FIFO reads do not increment the read address, mem reads do. **VMEReadMem** and
**VMEReadMemSwapped** are available since MVLC firmware ``FW0036``.

The mapping of the **read** command depends on whether the `fifo` or `mem` flags
are specified. This is only used in combination with the MVLC stack accumulator.
